        <h1>To Install and operate Spot Energy Bill Generation System at Sub Division Level on BOOT basis in 7 O&M Circles.</h1>
        <p>Jaipur Discom ( JVVNL ) is engaged in distribution and supply of electricity in 12 districts of Rajasthan, namely Jaipur, Dausa, Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Kota, Bundi, Baran, Jhalawar, Sawaimadhopur, Tonk and Karauli.

<h2>JVVNL – Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited, Jaipur, Rajasthan.</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FFE4B5;">
    <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p> 1. Meter Reading was being noted in binders by the meter readers and submitted to the sub division.<br><br>
		2. The officers in the sub division would then validate the meter reading and enter them manually into MB11 sheets and then send it to the billing agency along with the group inputs, payments and sundry entries.<br><br>
		3. Billing agency would then enter them into a Computer system generate and print bills for onward distribution. The reports would also be generated along with the group.<br><br>
		4. The major challenge was to reduce the time from meter reading to bill delivery to consumer which took about 30 days.<br><br>
		5. The sub division officers had no corroboration on the readings, accounts etc., that were being recorded in the computer system except in the form of printed outputs.<br><br>
		6. In a nut shell it was a partially computerized system with lots of manual inputs, scope for errors, security concerns and dependency on a billing agency.<br><br>
		7. The Sub Division offices were in far flung areas with minimum infrastructure and staff.<br><br>
		8. The ageing infrastructure and staff could not able to comprehend to the new demands and growing consumer base resulting in further losses.<br><br>
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FFC0CB;">
    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
    <p> 
			1. IT solutions based on distributed architecture with Servers, Computer Systems, Printers, UPS and Application Software’s were deployed at sub division, division, circle, zone and DISCOM levels.<br><br>
			2. Spot Billing machines with capability to generate and print bills at consumer door step were implemented.<br><br>
			3. The data from the sub division was once in a day synchronized to the Circle, DISCOM level servers.<br><br>
			4. The software had dashboards, customer profiling and an exhaustive MIS report generation system at various levels of the Discom.<br><br>
			5. The required Meter Readers were deployed across the Discom.<br><br>
			6. Concerned Officers of JVVNL were trained on the computerized system.<br><br></p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FFE4B5;">
    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
    <p> 1. Error free transparent, accurate and reliable spot billing enhanced revenue and customer satisfaction.<br><br>
		2. Meter reading to cash was reduced from 45 days to 15 days improving cash flows.<br><br>
		3. Availability of IT system at the sub division level to the officers enhanced the efficiencies aiding in the improved revenue collections.<br><br>
		4. Manual entries and physical record submission were all eliminated resulting in accuracy and more availability of time for system improvement.<br><br>
		5. Comprehensive reports and information gave the management a 360-degree view of business and tools/data for effective decision-making.<br></p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#FFC0CB;">
    <h2>THE HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
